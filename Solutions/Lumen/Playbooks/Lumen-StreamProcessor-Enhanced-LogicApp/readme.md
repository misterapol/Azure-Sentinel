# Lumen-StreamProcessor-Enhanced-LogicApp

## Overview

This enhanced Logic App solution handles large Lumen threat intelligence files (100MB+) using proven patterns from other threat intelligence providers in the Azure Sentinel ecosystem. The solution processes large indicator files using a chunked download approach with HTTP Range headers, eliminating the need for external storage or Azure Functions.

## Key Features

- **Large File Support**: Handles hundreds of MB indicator files using only Logic Apps
- **In-Memory Processing**: No external storage required - all processing happens in-memory
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Processes indicators in configurable chunks (default: 100 per batch)
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects Microsoft Sentinel API limits (90 requests per minute)
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides detailed logging and progress monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry logic and failure tracking
- **Resume Capability**: Can handle interruptions and continue processing

## Architecture

The solution follows proven patterns used by other threat intelligence providers while using only Logic Apps native capabilities:

1. **Presigned URL Retrieval**: Gets download URL from Lumen API
2. **Chunked Download**: Gets file metadata and downloads in 5MB chunks using HTTP Range headers
3. **Incremental Processing**: Parses and processes indicators in batches as they're downloaded
4. **Rate-Limited Upload**: Uploads chunks to Sentinel with intelligent delays
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks processing status and performance metrics

## How It Solves the Large File Problem

### Original Challenge:
- HTTP action fails with 100MB+ files (Buffer size limit of 104857600 bytes)
- Logic Apps timeout on large file processing
- Sentinel API has strict limits (100 objects/request, 100 requests/minute)

### This Solution:
1. **Uses HTTP Range headers** to download file in 5MB chunks, avoiding buffer limitations
2. **Leverages native array processing** with `take()` and `skip()` functions for chunking
3. **Implements intelligent rate limiting** (65 seconds = ~90 requests/hour)
4. **Processes data incrementally** by downloading and processing in manageable chunks
5. **Provides comprehensive error handling** and retry logic

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Microsoft Sentinel Workspace**: With Threat Intelligence solution enabled
2. **Lumen API Key**: Valid API key for threat intelligence access
3. **Permissions**: Rights to deploy Logic Apps and create managed identity connections

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Grant Permissions

The Logic App managed identity needs Microsoft Sentinel Contributor role:

```bash
# Get the Logic App principal ID
principalId=$(az resource show --resource-group <rg-name> --name <playbook-name> --resource-type Microsoft.Logic/workflows --query identity.principalId -o tsv)

# Grant Microsoft Sentinel Contributor role
az role assignment create \
  --assignee $principalId \
  --role "Microsoft Sentinel Contributor" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<rg-name>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<workspace-name>"
```

### 2. Configure API Connection

1. Navigate to the Logic App in Azure Portal
2. Go to **API Connections**
3. Configure the **Sentinel connection** to use managed identity
4. Test the connection

### 3. Monitor Performance

The Logic App provides detailed progress tracking:
- Total indicators processed
- Processing duration
- Chunk processing status and statistics

## Chunked Download Approach

To overcome the 100MB buffer limitation in Logic Apps, this solution uses HTTP Range headers to download files in manageable chunks:

1. **HEAD Request**: First gets file metadata, including Content-Length
2. **Chunked Downloading**: Splits the download into 5MB chunks using HTTP Range headers
   - Each request uses `Range: bytes=start-end` header
   - Handles 206 Partial Content responses and processes each chunk
   - Processes status 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) as end-of-file indicator
3. **Incremental Processing**: Each chunk is parsed and added to the collected data
4. **Batch Processing**: Once all chunks are downloaded, processes the indicators in batches for Sentinel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **BadRequest Error (Buffer Size Exceeded)**
   - This happens when a file is larger than 104857600 bytes (100MB)
   - Solution: The chunked download approach should prevent this error

2. **HTTP 416 Status (Requested Range Not Satisfiable)**
   - This is normal and indicates the file download is complete
   - It happens when requesting a byte range past the end of the file

3. **Timeout During Processing**
   - Increase the timeout in the Until loops if processing very large files
   - Current setting: PT8H (8 hours) should be sufficient for most files

4. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure the Logic App has Microsoft Sentinel Contributor role
   - Verify the API connection is configured to use Managed Identity

5. **Self-reference Error in Variable Updates**
   - Error: "Self reference is not supported when updating the value of variable"
   - Solution: We use concat() instead of union() for array merging to avoid self-references
   - Affects: MergeIndicatorArrays and MergeFinalIndicatorArrays actions

### Monitoring and Debugging

The Logic App includes comprehensive logging:
- Check "LogRangeRequest" outputs to see the byte ranges requested
- "Log_FileMetadata" shows details about the file being processed
- Each chunk processing step has detailed logging of progress
- Success/failure rates
- Performance metrics (indicators per minute)

## How It Works

### Processing Flow

1. **Initialization**: Sets up tracking variables for progress monitoring
2. **Get Presigned URL**: Calls Lumen API to get download URL
3. **Stream Large File**: Downloads JSON using chunked transfer mode
4. **Parse Indicators**: Parses the large JSON response in memory
5. **Chunk Processing**: Iterates through indicators in configurable chunks
6. **Rate-Limited Upload**: Uploads each chunk with appropriate delays
7. **Progress Tracking**: Logs detailed progress and performance metrics
